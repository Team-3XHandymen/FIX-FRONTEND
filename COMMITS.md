Commit msg:Client sign up Integration with database 1
Changes made: 
    *Changed the sign up interface of clerk to enter a username and address the user by the new username.
    *Integrated clerk sign up to trigger creating a new user in the database collection-clients with minimal data; username,email,clerkuserid, created time.
    *Here is the flow: 
    User Signs Up (Index.tsx)
├── Attempts to create client record once
├── If new user → Client created successfully
├── If existing user → Silently handles 409 conflict
└── User marked as processed (no infinite loops)

User Navigates to Dashboard (ClientDashboard.tsx)
├── Fetches client data from database
├── Displays clean, professional interface
└── No debug information cluttering the UI
Notes:getting errors for inline codes.

Commit msg: "Added autofil for the registration form"
Changes made: 
    *Instead of asking the user to provide the same information several times, we now use the existing client information of the same profile when a client registers as a service provider. keeping the access to edit if the client wants to do so.
    *Service provider dashboard now opens in a seperate tab for ease of access and separation of two profiles.
